Based on my activity in Slack, what animal would I be?

I'll check your recent Slack activity to get a sense of your communication style and personality!
Based on your Slack activity, I'd say you'd be a honeybee !

Here's why:

You're constantly buzzing between different hives - Your activity shows you jumping between technical channels, team discussions, customer engagements, and product feedback channels. You're pollinating knowledge across the organization!

You're a worker bee - Looking at your messages, you're deeply in the weeds helping people solve problems: troubleshooting CodeQL issues, answering GHAS questions, testing features, filing bugs, reviewing PRs, and supporting customers. You're productive and hands-on.

You help the hive thrive - People constantly sparkle you () for helping them out, whether it's late-night AI assistance, customer support, or technical guidance. You're clearly someone the team relies on.

You collect and share resources - You maintain things like the awesome-codeql repo, create shortcuts for teams, share knowledge about CodeQL queries, and help people find the right information.

You communicate A LOT - Bees do waggle dances to share info; you're active across tons of channels keeping everyone informed and connected.

You're a bit... buzzy - Your messages show personality with emojis plus commentary that shows you don't take yourself too seriously while still getting serious work done.

Plus, you work with Swift code, and bees are pretty swift themselves!
